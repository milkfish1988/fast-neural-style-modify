Created for colorsketch project, modified from fast-neural-style.
aims to:
1) evaluate the quality for generating gouache style image
2) add boundary control for fast neural style
3) create a style image set for gouache style instead of just using only one style image
4) blank area insertion based on depth info
5) color smooth and color transfer
